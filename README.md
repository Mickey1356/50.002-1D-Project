# 50.002-1D-Project: Greedy Dora

This is our 1D Project for SUTD's 50.002 Computational Structures. We were tasked to design a game using Lucid/Verilog in Mojo.

## How to play
Storyline: Dora the Explorer is in a crumbling cave full of Diamond on the floor. She needs to get out soon or the cave will collapse on her, however, greedy Dora wants to pick up all the Diamond lying everywhere on the floor. Thus, she has to walk the whole cave without exploring repeated tile and end up at the exit point. 

Objective: To exit the cave with all the Diamond using the least number of steps 

Rules:
1. Dora can only move up, down, left, right. Diagonal movements are not allowed.

2. Dora must explore every tile exactly once, no more no less

3. Dora must end up at the exit tile after exploring every single tile

4. Dora cannot explore a tile with pitfalls (boundaries and pitfalls are indicated by the lack of lights, LED is off)
